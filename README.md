this website is for notes it saves your notes to local storage so you can open them up at any time

initialy tere was meant to be more to this site however i ignored KISS and ended up recreatingt his site multiple times (lesson learned)
there will be more added at some point in the future i wil return to this app and do what i originaly intended to do

updates and bugs:


. original design was 4 buttons in the center of the screen (redesigned)
. storage bug (fixed)
. creating mutiple instences was causing the storage to incorrenctly save ("new" feature removed)
. notes were bieng saved across all the "edit" divs (fixed)
. checkboxes not suplaying the correct class (found bug working on it)
. games button removed due to zero content
. links button removed due to zero content
